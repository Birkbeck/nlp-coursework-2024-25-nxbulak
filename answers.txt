1d) When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable estimator of text difficulty?
Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum)

Answer:
The Flesch Kincaid (FK) score is not a very reliable estimator in various scenarios.
As discussed in Lecture 5, classification tasks are likely to involve specialised language
(examples include scientific texts or legal documents). The downfall of FK in this instance
is that it relies only on sentence length and syllable count, ignoring domain-specific
vocabulary complexity.An alternative that may be more reliable is the Type-Token Ratio
(TTR). As mentioned in Lecture 3, TTR is able to give a simple estimate of text complexity
so this may be a better approach. Another downfall of FK is that it lacks contextual knowledge.
In Lecture 1, we discussed the emphasis on the need to comprehend the language properties
beyond the surface features. An example of this could even be the text within PartOne.py where
the FK score for the 'North and South' novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (1855) had a score of
6.6552 meaning it was assessed at an older primary school/younger secondary school student age,
however, it fails to grasp that the text is a 19th century novel and would require historical
and cultural knowledge that often a higher level student (such as college/university) may lack.
