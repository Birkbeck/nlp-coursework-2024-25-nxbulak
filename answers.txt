1d) When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable
estimator of text difficulty? Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum)

Answer:
lect 5 - classification tasks may likely involve
specialised language (e.g. scientific texts, legal docs etc)

FK - only focus on sentance length and syllable count
over the semantic complexity - lect 3 on type-token
ratio (ttr) being able to give simple estimate of text
complexity may be a better method to use

also misses contextual knowledge - lect 1 discussed
emphasis on the need to understand language properties
beyond surface features (e.g. the novels we're looking
into now -  it suggests north and south has a score of
6.6552 (around older primary school age/young secondary
school age) but it's a 19th century novel and requires
historical and cultural knowledge that often a high level
student (college/university level) may lack
