1d) When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable
estimator of text difficulty? Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum)

Answer:
The Flesch Kincaid (FK) score is arguably not a very
reliable estimator in various scenarios. As discussed
in Lecture 5, classification tasks are likely to involve
specialised language (examples include scientific texts
or legal documents). The downfall of FK in this instance
is that it only focuses on sentance length and syllable
count over semantic complexity of the texts. An alternative
that may be more reliable would be using Type-Toke Ratio
(TTR). As mentioned in Lecture 3, TTR is able to give a
simple estimate of text complexity so this may be a better
approach. Another example
